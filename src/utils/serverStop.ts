 * Helper function to allow better handling of keep-alive connections for
 * graceful termination of a server. Calling `server.close()` will stop the server
 * from accepting new connections, but existing keep-alive aren't closed nor handled
 * in any special way by default. https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2642 shows
 * that this can keep a server for being shutdown cleanly after serving ongoing requests.
 *
 * This function will keep track of all opened connections and ongoing requests.
 *
 * The main idea is trying to serve all ongoing requests before shutting down the
 * server while trying to minimize the "socket hangup" or "connection reset"
 * errors on clients.
 *
 * Once the server starts being terminated, the server will reply with
 * Connection: close headers to signal clients not to send requests on existing
 * connections because they will be closed. This is done to minimize the chance
 * of closing a connection while there is an in-flight request to the server.
 *
 * All connections for which a Connection: close response has been sent, will be
 * terminated after handling the last request.
 *
 * After a timeout, all idle connections with no ongoing requests will be closed,
 * even if they haven't received the Connection: close header.
 *
 * After a bigger timeout, if some connections are still keeping the server
 * open, all connections will be forced closed and ongoing requests will not
 * send a response.
